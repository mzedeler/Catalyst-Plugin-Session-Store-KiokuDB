NAME
    Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Store::KiokuDB - Store sessions using KiokuDB

SYNOPSIS
        # In Catalyst
        use Catalyst qw/
                        Session
                        Session::State::Whatever
                        Session::Store::KiokuDB
                        /;
        
    # Configure it
        MyApp->config->{session}->{kiokuDir} = '/path/to/storage/dir';
        # or
        MyApp->config->{session}->{kiokuObject} = KiokuDB->new(...);

        # then use it as you would any session plugin

DESCRIPTION
    This session storage module will store data using KiokuDB. Aside from
    that it does pretty much the very same things other session modules do.

CONFIGURATION
    Under the "session" key in your configuration parameters, you can use
    "kiokuDir" which points to a directory in which KiokuDB will store its
    data, "kiokuObject" which allows you to reuse an existing KiokuDB
    instance or "kiokuModel" which points the name of a "Catalyst" model
    that must be of class Catalyst::Model::KiokuDB (typically just
    'kiokudb').

METHODS
    These are the classic store methods from
    Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Store.

  get_session_data
  store_session_data
  delete_session_data
  delete_expired_sessions
    This one is currently a no-op.

  setup_session
